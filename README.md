# NLP-on-Wines-Reviews

This project analyzes wine reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It explores various aspects such as sentiment analysis, text preprocessing, and data visualization. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from wine reviews, helping consumers and businesses understand trends and preferences.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from **Wine Reviews**, containing multiple reviews with ratings, descriptions, and other relevant details. Each review consists of:
- **Review Text**: The written review by users
- **Points**: Rating given to the wine
- **Price**: The price of the wine
- **Country**: The country where the wine originates
- **Variety**: Type of wine (e.g., Pinot Noir, Chardonnay)

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword Removal
  - Lemmatization
  - Lowercasing
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Assigning sentiment scores to reviews
  - Identifying positive and negative aspects
- **Text Visualization**:
  - Word clouds
  - Bar charts for most common words
  - Distribution of ratings
- **Model Training**:
  - Classification of wine reviews based on rating
  - Machine learning models to predict sentiment and categorize wines

## Usage
- Open the notebook and execute cells sequentially to explore the analysis.
- Modify parameters as needed to test different NLP techniques.
- Interpret visualizations to gain insights from the wine reviews dataset.
